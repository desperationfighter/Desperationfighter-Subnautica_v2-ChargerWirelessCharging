# Desperationfighter-Subnautica_v2-ChargerWirelessCharging

Thanks to "Tom Stone / The Hive" for creating the Charger Chip Icon
Special Thanks To EldritchCarMaker for giving me some coding advices including Unity related questions.

This Mod is the Updates Version supporting Subnautica v2.x and Nautilus.
If you use Legency (with QMM and SML) then please use my old Mod.

This Mod add Wireless Charging function to every Charger. On default every Tool in your Inventory will be charged in range of an Charger. Multiple Chargers stack in loading your Tools. But only One Tool(/Battery) will be charged at time.

With an additional craftable Chip you can also charge Loose Batteries. Tools have always highest Priority for charging. But What tool will be charged is random. Only Batteries that are supposte to be loaded by the Charger will be charged.

Charge Speed and Range can be changed in the Settings. Also you can disable the need of the Chip. Due to transfer looses the Wireless charging gives you only 85% of the default charge.

To make sure your Base or Cyclops does not run out of Energy a 30% security shutdown is build in. That means the Wireless charging function will stopp until you regenerate energy.

The Functions of the Charger itself is unchanged. That means it will still dry out your Base in worst case. Also you can charge Batties in it while using the Wireless Function.

How to config this Mod ? Look at the Ingame Mod Menu for Setting. If the Mod is closed you can alternativ change setting in the "config.json" file in the BepInex Config Folder.

Plans for the Future (I donâ€™t give any guarantee) -> Currently no plans.
